So he’s doubled the size of the government
Wasn't the trouble with much of our previous government size
Look in his eyes, see how he lies, follow the scent of his enterprise
Centralizing national credit and making American credit competitive
If we don’t stop it, we aid and abet it.
I have to resign!
Somebody has to stand up for the South!
Well, somebody has to stand up to his mouth!
If there’s a fire you’re trying to douse,
You can’t put it out from inside the house!
I’m in the cabinet, I am complicit in watching him grabbin' at power and kiss it.
If Washington isn’t gon’ listen to disciplined dissidents,
This is the difference, this kid is OUT!
